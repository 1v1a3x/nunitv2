NUnit V2
========

NUnit V2 IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED OR UPDATED. NO BUGS ARE ACCEPTED.

The final version of NUnit V2 was 2.6.3. That code is avaialble here for anyone who needs it. Further NUnit
development is taking place under a separate NUnit 3.0 project. Currently, that project is located on
Launchpad at http://launchpad.net/nunit-3.0 but it wll be moving to GitHub by the end of October.

NUnit is a test framework for all .Net languages, running on Microsoft .NET and Mono.

NUnit is written in C# but can run tests written in any language that generates managed code. Initially ported 
from JUnit, it has been completely redesigned to take advantage of the features of the common language runtime, 
such as custom attributes, generics and lambda expressions.

NUnit V2 was initially hosted on Sourceforge. The last Sourceforge release was NUnit 2.5.2. Beginning with NUnit 2.5.3, 
releases were made on Launchpad, and mmay still be found there.
