Release Notes for NUnit 2.1 Beta 1 - Windows Install Package
July 22, 2003

This is the third major release of NUnit and the second since it was 
rewritten to take advantage of .NET custom attributes. Highlights of 
this release include support for the .NET framework 1.1, the ability 
to run test suites across multiple assemblies, improvements to the 
GUI interface, new command line switches for both GUI and Console 
runners, some degree of integration with Visual Studio and new 
TestFixtureSetup and TestFixtureTeardown attributes
