Release Notes for NUnit 2.1 RC1 - Final Release
September 1, 2003

This is the third major release of NUnit and the second since it was 
rewritten to take advantage of .NET custom attributes. Highlights of 
this release include support for the .NET framework 1.1, the ability 
to run test suites across multiple assemblies, improvements to the 
GUI interface, new command line switches for both GUI and Console 
runners, some degree of integration with Visual Studio and new 
TestFixtureSetup and TestFixtureTeardown attributes

Changes from RC1

Fixes were made to the gui layout including use of a fixed font in
the Errors & Failures tab so that unmatched strings would line up
properly. 

Changes From Beta 2

Tests now execute in the same order as they are displayed in the gui.
The gui recognizes an appsetting to cause it to run tests in the STA.
The version of the .NET framework being used is displayed in the About 
Box. Tests are now reloaded when the active configuration is deleted.
Various bugs have been fixed. 

Changes From Beta 1

This release includes separate configuration files for use with .NET
versions 1.0 and 1.1. Both versions are copied and the correct config
for the current system is installed ready for use. A sample config
file for use with tests built against NUnit 2.0 is included.

Substantial changes have been made to error and exception reporting.
The exception type is listed along with all inner exceptions. In the
console runner, this includes a full stacktrace. The full trace for
exceptions that are caught by the GUI runner is now available under
the Tools | Exception Details... menu item.

This release has been verified to install and run under Windows 98.
The feature of watching for changes in the assemblies and reloading
them automatically is disabled in this environment. We haven't tested
under Windows ME, but believe it will work in that environment as well.

Installation

Download and execute the nunit-v2.1.4.msi file. By default the installation 
program places the all files in the directory C:\Program Files\Nunit V2.1. 
In the installation directory there are three sub-directories: bin, doc 
and src. The samples directory is located under src.

If you prefer to build from source, download NUnit-V2.1.4-src.zip and 
unzip it to a directory of your choice, preserving all path information. 
Build using the NAnt build or in the Visual Studio .NET 2003 IDE.

Documentation

The Readme.pdf file is installed in the doc directory by the windows
installation and is also available as a separate download.
