<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>First and foremost, we have done our best to insure that this program was 
	developed test-first. As such we will accept no code changes without associated 
	tests. As for bug fixes we plan to follow the procedure that we write a failing 
	unit test first and then fix it. In this fashion, the number of tests that we 
	have will grow over time. Lastly, if a change breaks an existing test it is the 
	responsibility of the person making the change to first understand the 
	ramification of the change and either fix the test or alter the modification 
	that caused the problem. That said, if you are interested, so are we, please 
	help make NUnit the best xUnit tool in any language.</p>
<h3>NUnit Development Guidelines</h3>
<p>Our goal is to have as many people participate in the development as possible. 
	However, the normal random development of open-source often leads to projects 
	that stall and then die. Too often these projects are technology driven and 
	once the technical problem has been solved the developer loses interest. We do 
	not want this to happen to NUnit. So we are attempting to put in a minimal 
	amount of process to insure that the development moves forward in a way that 
	the community chooses.</p>
<h3>Feature Selection/Prioritization</h3>
<p>It is incumbent on all users to suggest new features that would be useful and to 
	participate in the prioritization of the features. It is your program after 
	all, why not try and make it better. These requests should be sent to <A href="mailto:nunit-developer@lists.sourceforge.net">
		nunit-developer@lists.sourceforge.net</A>. The requests should be more than 
	one line of text. They should be accompanied by additional information, such as 
	code examples and possible suggestions on implementation. They should also 
	include pros/cons of why this should be part of NUnit.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>There is a balance that needs to occur for the development of 
	NUnit. We could just allow NUnit features to emerge out of the feature requests 
	and the product would be completely driven by the community. On the other hand 
	NUnit is a unit-testing tool for on the .NET platform. So, overall the 
	direction of new development must exist with the confines of this being a unit 
	testing tool for .NET.</p>
<p>Once a feature request has been submitted it will be consolidated with other 
	like feature requests and added to the list of features that have been 
	suggested. There may be an initial poll to determine if the feature should even 
	be prioritized.</p>
<p>Since we plan on doing two week iterations these feature request may be split up 
	in order to be accomplished within an iteration. Based on developer 
	availability every two weeks the features that are desired the most by the 
	community will be the ones that are worked on. We will be developing a poll to 
	be implemented on this site to facilitate this.</p>
<h3>Iteration Development</h3>
<p>An iteration begins with an iteration planning meeting. At this meeting all 
	current bugs are reviewed along with the current highest rated features. Based 
	on the amount of developer availability certain items will be committed to the 
	iteration.</p>
<p>If you are interested in participating in an iteration send a message to <A href="mailto:nunit-developer@lists.sourceforge.net">
		nunit-developer@lists.sourceforge.net</A>. Along with your email please 
	indicate the amount of time that you capable of spending within the next 
	iteration and given a current scan of the bugs and features what you would most 
	like to work on. If you would like to work on something that is not on the 
	iteration list you will need to submit a feature request and have it be 
	prioritized like everything else.</p>
<p>As part of committing to work on features we would like developers to break 
	their work up into tasks. A task duration should be no longer than 1 or 2 days. 
	Upon completion code should be checked into the source code control system. The 
	code will be reviewed by the one of the Admins for adherence to the coding 
	standard and other coding guidelines.</p>
<h3>Coding Guidelines</h3>
<p><SPAN class="GramE">Test-Driven Development.</SPAN>
	This is non-negotiable. There will be no code that is accepted without 
	associated tests. Also, we expect that
	<SPAN class="SpellE">Refactoring</SPAN>
	is part of your everyday activities so if there is
	<SPAN class="GramE">a need to <SPAN class="SpellE">refactor</SPAN> do</SPAN>
	it.</p>
<p>For
	<SPAN class="SpellE">bugfixes</SPAN>
	there must also be an associated test which exposes the bug. This allows the 
	tests to increase over time and the overall coverage of the tests improves. 
	There may be times when it is not possible to have a test. In these cases 
	please let us know the circumstances and we will decide if there is a way to 
	test a particular item.</p>
<p>It also the goal that any current download from the source code control system 
	is releasable. Therefore, it is incumbent upon you to insure that you run all 
	the tests on code prior to check-in. Also, once the files are checked-in you 
	should download the current files into a new folder, recompile it and run the 
	tests. This verifies that what is in the source code control system is at least 
	no worse than it was before you started.</p>
<h3>Code Samples</h3>
<p>
The following is a code sample that demonstrates the style in which we want 
code to be written for the project.
