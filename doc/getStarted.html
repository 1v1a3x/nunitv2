<h2>Getting Started with NUnit</h2>
<p>If you haven't already done so, go to our <a href="http://www.nunit.org/download.html">
	Download</a> page, select a version of NUnit and download it. The <a href="installation.html">
	Installation</a> page contains instructions for installing on your system.</p>
<p>To get started using NUnit, read the <a href="files/QuickStart.doc">Getting Started</a>
	document. This article demonstrates the development process with NUnit in the 
	context of a C# banking application. Check the <a href="samples.html">
	Samples</a> page for additional examples, including some in VB.Net, J# and 
	managed C++.</p>
<h3>Which Test Runner to use?</h3>
<p>NUnit has two different ways to run your tests. The <a href="#console">
	console runner</a>, nunit-console.exe, is the fastest to launch, but is not 
	interactive. The <a href="#gui">gui runner</a>, 
	nunit-gui.exe, is a Windows Forms application that allows you to work 
	selectively with your tests and provides graphical feedback.</p>
<h3><a name="console"><b>Console Runner</b></a></h3>
<p>The nunit-console.exe program is a text-based runner and can be used when you 
	want to run all your tests and don&#146;t need a red/yellow/green indication of 
	success or failure.</p>
<p>It is useful for automation of tests and integration into other systems. It 
	automatically saves its results in XML format, allowing you to produce reports 
	or otherwise process the results. The following is a screenshot of the console 
	program.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
      <img src="img/console-mock.gif", width="509", height="288">
</div>

<p>In this example, nunit-console has just run the tests in the mock-assembly.dll 
	that is part of the NUnit distribution. This assembly contains seven tests, 
	three of which are not run. The first ignored test has an incorrect method 
	signature, the second has been marked with the Ignore attribute and the third 
	uses the Explicit attribute, so that it can only be run directly. Click 
	<a href="files/TestResult.xml">here</a> to see the XML produced for this test run.</p>
<h3><a name="gui"><b>Gui Runner</b></a></h3>
<p>The nunit-gui.exe program is a graphical runner. It shows the tests in an 
	explorer-like browser window and provides a visual indication of the success or 
	failure of the tests. It allows you to selectively run single tests or suites 
	and reloads automatically as you modify and re-compile your code. The following 
	is a screenshot of nunit-gui running the same mock-assembly.dll shown in the 
	previous example.</p>

<div class="screenshot">
     <img src="img/gui-screenshot.gif", width="550", height="385">
</div>

<p>As you can see, the tests that were not run are marked with a yellow circle, 
	while those that were run successfully are colored green. If any tests had 
	failed, they would be marked red.</p>
