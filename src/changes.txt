NUnit 2.3.6024 Snapshot

* Classes AggregatingTestRunner and MultipleTestDomainRunner have been added 
to allow running each assemblies tests in a separate domain. The feature is
accessible by means of an option in the gui or by specifying multiple assemblies
on the command line of nunit-console. There are still some issues with running
individual tests when using this feature.

* Options are available to disable automatic creation of suites for each 
namespace and to merge tests from multiple assemblies into a single tree.

* Tests and TestInfos now store a multi-part TestName object, analogous to an
AssemblyName, rather than just a simple text name.

* Created new nunit.common project as part of NUnitCore to hold interfaces and
  other types that are referenced from outside the core..

* References: gui no longer refers to core but to common.

NUnit 2.3.6006 Snapshot

* Modified ITest interface to hide some internal implementation and added a new
  Properties property. There is currently no way to set this, but it will allow 
  defining new properties on tests by a name/value pair.

* Modified TestRunner interface to simply return a bool from the Load methods. 
  Clients wanting the entire tree can use the Test property of the interface to
  get it. Some clients did not need so much info, which is why it was changed.

* Changed Key property to ID in ITest, Test, TestInfo and TestNode. The old
  AssemblyKey property is now gone. It was a bit silly, since it gave a Test
  knowledge of it's index in an array maintained by another object. Tests are 
  now uniquely identified by the key and there should no longer be issues of 
  duplicate entries in the tree, so long as a new Test object is constructed
  for each test in the code. However, this change creates some problems for 
  updating the tree on reload, since newly loaded tests have a completely 
  different identity from those that were already in the tree. We'll work on 
  the heuristics of matching the reloaded tests to the tree for the next drop.

* Fixed a problem whereby an exception in unloading a domain crashed the application.

* Fixed a problem whereby a /fixture arg on the gui command line was ignored.

NUnit 2.3.53465 Snapshot

* Changed registry location and added code to copysettings from old location.

* Added TestInfo and TestNode to core. These are serializable classes and can
  be passed to the gui runner without worrying about references to actual Test
objects. Removed UITestNode from nunit.util since TestNode takes its place.

* Added an int key to Test and began using it in the gui instead of UniqueName.

* Fixed nant scripts and app key paths to be able to build under Linux.
  Thanks to Shmarya for this one.

* Fixed an unreported bug regarding the disabling of / for command line args 
  under Linux. This should work now.

* Replaced View menu with Tree menu in the GUI. View menu will enable and 
  disable parts of the GUI like the status bar - which is implemented - 
  and the tabs - still under development.

* Added option to change font in gui

* We now use base class name in the tree ( i.e. Class.Method ) to distinguish 
  a method inherited from a base class from one of the same name in the class 
  itself. Among other things, this allows showing a test method redefined with
  'new' along with the method inherited from the base class - not that I 
  recommend doing this. :-)

* Tests are now sorted in the same order for console and gui. I've left 
  assemblies within NUnit projects unsorted, these are displayed and run 
  just as they are ordered in the xml file.
